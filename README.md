snark: Scalable Nested ARray toolKit
=====

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fnothaft/snark.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fnothaft/snark)

A distributed nested vector library for Scala.

What is a nested vector?
=====

A good question.

The long answer lies [here](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~blelloch/papers/Ble90.pdf).

The short answer however, is that nested vectors are a data structure meant for data parallel computing. They can be used as equivalent to 1D or 2D arrays, but that just scratches the surface of their power.

Why should we use them?

For now, you'll have to be content with the link above. As time allows (and as I build functionality), more will appear here.
